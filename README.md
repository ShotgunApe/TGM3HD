TGM3HD is a resolution patcher for Tetris The Grand Master 3.
Taken from AltInput by Altimor: https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/altinput

In fact, this is just the resolution patching part of AltInput, with everything else removed. The input part has been replaced to work with JConfig's JVSEmu library, acting as its hooking loader, so be sure to have it on the same folder. Still, the chosen library to hook can be changed in the code.
